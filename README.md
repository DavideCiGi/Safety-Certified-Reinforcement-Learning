# Probabilistic Safety-Certified Deep Reinforcement Learning for Discrete Time Systems Using High-Order Discrete-Time Control Barrier Functions

Tensorflow2 implementation of the RL-HODTCBF algorithm described in my master thesis. For an in depth explanation feel free to contact me.

Method is tested on the type 1 diabetes patient model, the Bergman model.

### Usage
Experiments can be run by calling:
```
python main.py
```

Hyper-parameters can be modified with different arguments to main.py.

### Results
Learning curves found in the thesis, but aesthetic adjustments, are found under /plots.

Data obtained from the training of the algorithm and evaluation of the obtained policy are found in /data.
